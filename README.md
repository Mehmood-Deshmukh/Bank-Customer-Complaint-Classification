# Customer Complaint Classification Project

## Overview

This project focuses on developing an automated system to classify customer complaints submitted to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau into five distinct categories: credit reporting, debt collection, mortgages and loans, credit cards, and retail banking. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms, we aim to enhance the efficiency of complaint handling within financial institutions.

For a detailed understanding of the project, please refer to the full report: [report.md](report.md).
